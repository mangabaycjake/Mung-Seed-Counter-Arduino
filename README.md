# Mung-Seed-Counter-Arduino
*My mini project*. A system built to count mung seeds and demonstrate different Arduino sensors and actuators. This was submitted for my BS Electrical Engineering course at UPLB.

This mung seed counter utilizes the generic 30 sensors available at online markets. It's main restriction is the limit of usable servo motor (1). It can be an inspiration for hobbyists and students.

## Sensors
### Light-Dependent Resistor
Determines mung seed passage by receiving light.
### Line tracking sensor
Detect mung seed queue above the line.

## Actuators
### Servo Motor
Main control for seed movement gates
### Laser
Provides high contrast light
### Motor
Provides vibration for seed rolling
### 5V Relay Module
Controls motor plus external power
### 16x2 LCD + I2C  Module
Shows count and progress
### RGB Light
Additional interfacing, displays status of counting
### Passive Buzzer
Additiona; interfacing, alerts for starting and ending
